## Overview
Credalytix is an advanced financial data analysis platform engineered to automate and optimize the credit risk assessment process for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). By extracting transactional data directly from raw bank statement PDFs, the platform calculates critical cash flow metrics, predicts default probabilities, simulates adverse financial scenarios, and leverages Generative AI to provide personalized risk narratives—all within seconds.

## Target Audience
1. **Lending Institutions (Banks & NBFCs):** Enables rapid, data-driven credit decisions by instantly parsing dense financial documents into actionable, standardized risk metrics and identifying loan affordability.
2. **MSME Business Owners:** Provides businesses with transparent insights into their own financial footprint, illuminating how lenders view their cash flow volatility, liquidity, and borrowing capacity.

## Core Features & Capabilities
- **Automated Statement Parsing:** Extracts tabular transaction data directly from raw PDF bank statements (specifically tailored for HDFC formats), categorizing inflows and outflows.
- **Dynamic Risk Evaluation:** Calculates a definitive credit score (out of 900) based on stability, liquidity, existing EMI burden, and payment discipline.
- **Stress Testing Engine:** Simulates critical financial shocks (e.g., 30% revenue drop alongside a 20% expense increase) to observe if the business surplus collapses below EMI obligations, yielding a "Stressed Score".
- **Loan Optimization & Structuring:** Actively maps the user's requested loan tenure and amount against their actual net surplus to recommend adjusted, safer borrowing parameters.
- **Generative AI Advisory:** Leverages Google's Gemini models to ingest calculated financial ratios and produce a human-like, personalized advisory narrative on the business's current operating strength.

## Key Financial Metrics Explained
- **Base Credit Score (300-900):** A composite metric reflecting the overall default risk of the business. Higher scores indicate stronger repayment probability based on historical cash flow.
- **Stressed Score:** A predictive secondary score generated by applying macroeconomic shocks to the cash flow, exposing hidden vulnerabilities in liquidity and surplus.
- **Net Monthly Surplus:** The absolute remaining capital after subtracting the average monthly outflows from the average monthly inflows.
- **Liquidity Buffer:** A ratio representing how many months a business could sustain its average operational expenses using only its current cash reserves, assuming zero new revenue.
- **Cash Flow Consistency:** The percentage of months within the analyzed period where the net surplus remained positive.
- **Revenue Volatility:** The standard deviation of incoming revenue streams, acting as an indicator of seasonality or income instability.
- **Surplus Coverage Ratio:** The ratio of the net monthly surplus to the proposed monthly EMI. A ratio below 1.5x generally flags high borrowing risk.

## Technology Stack
**Frontend:**
- React 18
- Vite 5
- Tailwind CSS (for responsive, modern UI design)
- Recharts (for dynamic data visualization)

**Backend:**
- Python 3.9+ 
- Flask (REST API framework)
- pdfplumber & Pandas (for PDF extraction and tabular data aggregation)
- Google Generative AI (Gemini integration for AI text synthesis)
- MongoDB & PyMongo (for secure user authentication and data persistence)
